Hereâ€™s a refined **AI prompt focused specifically on verifying mobile responsiveness and preparing a project for mobile-friendly deployment**, including for Vercel hosting:

**Prompt:**

> I want to ensure my project is fully optimized for **mobile devices** before deploying it to **Vercel using the CLI**. Please review the codebase and assist with the following:
>
> 1. **Mobile Responsiveness Audit**:
>
>    * Scan all components, pages, and layouts for mobile responsiveness.
>    * Check use of responsive units (%, vw, vh, rem, em) instead of fixed pixels.
>    * Validate media queries exist and are properly implemented for common breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px).
>    * Ensure layout adapts properly on both portrait and landscape orientations.
> 2. **UI/UX Best Practices for Mobile**:
>
>    * Ensure touch targets (buttons, links) are large enough (at least 44px).
>    * Check font sizes for readability on small screens.
>    * Make sure images are optimized and do not overflow containers.
>    * Detect any horizontal scrolling and fix overflow issues.
>    * Confirm mobile-friendly navigation (hamburger menus, swipeable drawers, etc.).
> 3. **Performance Optimizations**:
>
>    * Lazy load images or heavy components.
>    * Compress assets and suggest optimal image formats (e.g., WebP).
>    * Eliminate render-blocking resources and unnecessary animations.
> 4. **Vercel Deployment Prep (Mobile-Focused)**:
>
>    * Verify the project builds successfully with mobile optimizations in place.
>    * Ensure the deployment does not break responsive layout (test with `vercel dev` locally).
>    * Create or validate the `vercel.json` file to ensure correct behavior post-deployment.
> 5. **Final Checklist**:
>
>    * Emulate mobile view in Chrome DevTools or use Lighthouse to confirm mobile usability score.
>    * Run `vercel` CLI deployment steps and verify that the live version behaves correctly on mobile.

Let me know the framework (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.) or share a preview of your layout if you want a version tailored more specifically.
